# Frost Shop Floor Data Entry
I made this app as part of my internship with FROST Converting Systems, Inc. 

You can test-drive the app at https://frost-shop-floor.herokuapp.com/.

The code in this repository is the live source code for the app used in production on FROST's local server. The code for the heroku version has been tweaked a little (switched databases, among other things) to work with Heroku.

Sincerely, Will
